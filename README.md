# Simple Linear Regression - Day 48 of 100 Days of Machine Learning  

This repository contains the implementation of **Simple Linear Regression**, part of the **100 Days of Machine Learning** challenge. The objective is to predict a continuous variable using one independent feature.

---

## 🧠 Objective  
Learn and implement simple linear regression to predict a dependent variable based on a single independent variable.

## 🚀 Steps Covered  

1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Loaded and explored data using **pandas**.  
   - Visualized relationships with **matplotlib**.

2. **Model Building**  
   - Utilized **scikit-learn**'s `LinearRegression` class to create a model.  
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

3. **Training & Evaluation**  
   - Trained the model using the training data.  
   - Evaluated performance using:
     - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**  
     - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**  
     - **R² Score**
